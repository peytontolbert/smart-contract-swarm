# Smart Contract Swarm

A sophisticated system for automated Solana smart contract development using a swarm of specialized AI agents.

## Overview

This project implements a sequential workflow of specialized agents to automate the process of creating, testing, and deploying Solana smart contracts. Each agent in the swarm is responsible for a specific aspect of the development process.

## Agent Workflow

1. **Requirement Analyzer**: Breaks down user requirements into technical specifications
2. **Contract Architect**: Designs the smart contract architecture
3. **Code Generator**: Generates the actual Solana smart contract code
4. **Security Auditor**: Performs security analysis and best practices check
5. **Test Generator**: Creates comprehensive test cases

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```
4. Edit `.env` with your:
   - OpenAI API key
   - Solana network preferences
   - Wallet configuration

## Usage

```python
from smart_contract_swarm import ContractSwarm

# Initialize the swarm
swarm = ContractSwarm()

# Define your smart contract requirements
requirements = """
Create a token vesting contract with:
- Linear vesting over 12 months
- Cliff period of 3 months
- Emergency pause functionality
"""

# Process the request
result = swarm.process_contract_request(requirements)
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Solana development environment
- Anchor framework
